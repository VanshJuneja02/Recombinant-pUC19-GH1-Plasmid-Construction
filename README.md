# Recombinant-pUC19-
This synthetic biology project features the in silico construction of a recombinant pUC19 plasmid carrying Homo sapiens growth hormone 1 (GH1), transcript variant 3. Tools like SnapGene, BioEdit, NEBcutter, and Addgene etc were used for sequence analysis, editing, restriction mapping, and plasmid visualization. Aimed at simulating gene cloning.
